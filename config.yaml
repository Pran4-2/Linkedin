  # STAR-method answers for behavioral questions (stored as compact strings)
  star_answers:
    "tell me about yourself": >
      I am a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in security monitoring,
      threat detection, and incident response. I am proficient with SIEM platforms,
      log analysis, and working in SOC environments. I am passionate about protecting
      digital assets and continuously improving security posture.
    "describe a challenge": >
      Situation: During a live incident, we detected a lateral-movement pattern in
      the SIEM at 2 AM. Task: I was the on-call analyst responsible for triage.
      Action: I isolated affected endpoints, correlated logs across five data sources,
      and escalated to Tier-3 within 20 minutes. Result: The attack was contained
      before reaching critical servers, with zero data exfiltration confirmed.
    "why this company": >
      Your company has a strong reputation for cutting-edge security operations
      and a culture of continuous learning, which aligns perfectly with my goal of
      growing as a SOC analyst and contributing to real-world threat mitigation.
    "weakness": >
      I sometimes over-document findings; however I have learned to balance
      thoroughness with speed by using standardised templates and time-boxing
      my reports.
